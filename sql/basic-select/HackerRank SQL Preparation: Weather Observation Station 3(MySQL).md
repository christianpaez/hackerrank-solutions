**Solution:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE ID % 2 = 0;
```

**Explanation:**

- `SELECT DISTINCT CITY`: This part of the query specifies that you want to retrieve the `CITY` column from the **STATION** table, and `DISTINCT` ensures that each city name is unique, eliminating any duplicates from the result.
- `FROM STATION`: Indicates that you are selecting data from the **STATION** table.
- `WHERE ID % 2 = 0`: This condition filters the rows to include only those cities where the `ID` is an even number. The modulo operation (`% 2 = 0`) checks if the `ID` is divisible by 2, meaning it's even.

This query will return a list of unique city names from the **STATION** table where the city has an even `ID` number. The result will exclude any duplicate city names.

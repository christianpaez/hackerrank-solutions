**Solution:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM CITY;
```

**Explanation:**

- `SELECT *`: The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character in SQL that means "all columns." This part of the query specifies that you want to retrieve all columns from the table.
- `FROM CITY`: Indicates that you are selecting data from the **CITY** table.

This query will return all the columns for every row in the **CITY** table. It's useful when you need to inspect or analyze all data available in the table without any specific filtering or conditions.
